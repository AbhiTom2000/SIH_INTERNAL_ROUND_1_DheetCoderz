## Technology Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

  1. **[Python](https://www.python.org/):**: The primary programming language for the application's logic and development.
  2. **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/):**: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
  3. **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):**: A data manipulation and analysis library used to handle the symptom-disease dataset.
  4. **[TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/):**: A library for processing textual data, including symptom extraction and analysis.
  5. **[FuzzyWuzzy](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/):**: A library for string matching and similarity calculations, used to identify similar symptoms.
  6. **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/):**: A library for natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stemming.
  7. **[Flask-CORS](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/1.10.3/):**: An extension for Flask that enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing the application to be accessed from different domains.



## Key Features

1. **Symptom-based prediction**: Users can enter their symptoms to receive potential diagnoses.
2. **Probability scores**: Each predicted disease is assigned a probability score indicating its likelihood.
3. **Additional information**: Users can access more details about predicted diseases, including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.
4. **User-friendly interface**: The app provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
5. **Integration with healthcare systems**: The app can potentially integrate with existing healthcare systems for seamless patient care.
6. **Data privacy**: The app prioritizes user data privacy and security.
7. **Regular updates**: The app is regularly updated to incorporate new medical knowledge and research.
