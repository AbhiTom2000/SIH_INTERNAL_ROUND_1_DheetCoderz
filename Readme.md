# AI-Enhanced Healthcare Diagnostics and Management System (inspired by ZK Medical Billing Platform)
**Project Overview** 

DoctorG is a web application designed to assist users in identifying potential health conditions based on their symptoms. By inputting their symptoms, users can receive a list of possible diseases along with their corresponding probability scores.

**Features**

- Symptom-based prediction: Users can enter their symptoms to receive potential diagnoses.
- Probability scores: Each predicted disease is assigned a probability score indicating its likelihood.
- Additional information: Users can access more details about predicted diseases, including symptoms, causes, and treatment options.

**Technologies Used**

- Python: The primary programming language for the backend.
- Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the web application.
- Machine Learning: A machine learning model is used to predict diseases based on symptoms.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques are employed to process user input and extract relevant symptoms.
- Database: A database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) is used to store symptom-disease data.

**Installation**

- Clone the repository:
  
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DoctorG.git


- Install requirements:
  
Bash
cd DoctorG
pip install -r requirements.txt


- Run the application:
  
Bash
python app.py


**Usage**

- Access the web application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port).
- Enter symptoms: Input your symptoms in the provided field.
- View predictions: The application will display a list of potential diseases along with their probability scores.
